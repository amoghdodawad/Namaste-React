React is very fast at DOM manipulation and it keeps the UI layer and Data layer in sync.

What makes React so fast? How does it work behind the scene?
- Reconciliation algorithm (React Fiber)
Assume that inside res-container there are n restaurant cards


|----------|
| Res-cont |

      |
      |
-------------------------
  |     |    |    |    |
  |     |    |    |    |
|----|               |-------|
| RC1|               |  RCn  |
|----|               |-------|

Before rendering this onto the DOM, React creates a VIRTUAL DOM, which is just a
normal JS Object.

Diff algorithm:
Diff algorithm finds difference between 2 virtual DOMs, that is the updated and the previous virtual DOM
and it will actually update the DOM on every render cycle.
